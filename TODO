Why don't we use this space to record the most pressing changes to make?

Sometimes I forget what is next to do and have to sift through my email and notes.

Update: Thanks! I'm working on these now... -M

1) Modify Visit_Assignment so that it recognizes when a call to malloc is fed through a cast
2) Are line numbers that show in messages before or after inclusion of "" files?
3) Modify whole shebang to use the latest version of pycparser
   Only obvious problem: structure of Compound node has changed; no longer a single Decl child

I'm working on 3) now. I've updated the visit_compound method so mixed pointer/non-pointer detection works.
Now I don't know whether to modify the mallocing part or attack #1)... Let's see what I can do for 1) before
my eyelids grow too heavy.
