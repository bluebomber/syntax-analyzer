"short range" tasks:
* collect the possible warnings into a list with IDs for easy identification (IN PROGRESS)
* organize the warning functionality into logical class structure, with appropriate methods
* give more meaningful names to some of the classes and methods (e.g., there were two getWarnings functions, one a global function, the other a method)

"medium range" tasks:
* neaten the code, moving more functionality into classes, minimizing reuse

"long range" tasks:
* reorganize code so that there is a single visitor class, with preferably only one pass through the code (at worst, two subclasses of the visitor class)
